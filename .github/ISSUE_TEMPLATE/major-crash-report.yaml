        **Please try following steps before report and tell me if the crash reproduces:**
        
        - Delete the config file to reset the config.

        - Tries Emerald Craft mod alone (with its dependency).
        
        - Find the smallest reproducible set of this crash - for example, if this crash occurs when you only install emeraldcraft, biomesoplenty and terrablender, even if you add some new mods, the smallest reproducible set is the three mods mentions above if the same crash occurs.
