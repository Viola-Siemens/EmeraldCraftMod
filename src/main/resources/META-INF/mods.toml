More crafts, biomes, piglin girls, and cute villagers!

I love villagers in minecraft. I hope so do you. And I also love piglins -- just because they look like girls with head covers!

With this mod, you can trade many other things with villagers, and with piglin-cutey, a new mob in the nether.

You can also do the emerald craft, the gold craft, and even craft some "trash" into building material to decorate your house with this mod!
